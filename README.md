# My_LangGraph_Company_Revenue
This project is a conversational assistant built using LangGraph &amp; LangChain. It allows users to interact with structured data (CSV file) through natural, multiturn dialogue while preserving context across queries. The design is modular by simply replacing the CSV file or the LLM model, the assistant can be adapted to answer Qs in different domains

I have used the below mentioned tools and libraries in the project
1. langchain and langgraph libraries.
2. ChatOpenAI by OpenAI, model - gpt-3.5-turbo
3. For Chunking - RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
4. For Embeddings and Vector DB, FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
5.
